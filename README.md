# README

This small app was built to handle one POST request to /celeb_birthdays

The POST request needs to have two parameters: {month: int, date: int}

The months start at 1 (January) and go to 12.  The date starts at 1 and goes to the end of the given month.

The route will return an object that looks like this:
